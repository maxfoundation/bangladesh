variable,meaning
district,Highest level of administrative unit
upazila,Administrative unit
union,Administrative unit
ward,"Administrative unit (anonymised, consistent between data sets)"
village,"Administrative unit (anonymised, consistent between data sets)"
hh_id,"ID for the household (anonymised, inconsistent between data sets)"
child_id,"ID for the child (anonymised, not present in other data sets). NB each child should be registered just once, those who are registered multiple times are flagged (see flag_duplicated)"
date,Date of the measurement (rounded to quarters)
gender,Gender of the child (M/F)
dob,Date of birth of the child (roudned to quarters). NB children registered several times with different dates of birth are flagged (see flag_different_dob)
height,Child height (with noise added of +/- 1cm)
weight,Child weight (with noise added of +/- 1kg)
cbmi,Child BMI
zlen,Z-score for length-for-age
flen,Flag indicating whether the zlen variable falls outside the bounds set by the WHO
zwei,Z-score for weight-for-age
fwei,Flag indicating whether the zwei variable falls outside the bounds set by the WHO
zwfl,Z-score for weight-for-length
fwfl,Flag indicating whether the zwfl variable falls outside the bounds set by the WHO
zbmi,Z-score for the child's BMI
fbmi,Flag indicating whether the zbmi variable falls outside the bounds set by the WHO
flag_duplicated_day,"Flag indicating whether two measurements were taken on the same day, calculated from the uncensored data"
flag_duplicated_quarter,"Flag indicating whether two measurements were taken in the same quarter. Generally one measurement per quarter should be taken and when doing analysis, weights should be adjusted to account for extra measurements or additional observations omitted altogether"
flag_obs_number,"When flag_duplicated_quarter is TRUE, this flag indicates whether this is first, second, etc. observation of that child in that quarter"
flag_different_dob,"Flag indicating whether the child_id was registered twice with different dates of birth. NB calculated from the uncensored data, so the variable dob may be the same when rounded to quarters"
flag_dob_number,"When flag_different_dob is TRUE, this flag indicates with which date of birth the z-scores were derived"
flag_under_zero,Flag indicating whether a child was had an age below 0 days according to the data entered
flag_no_match,Flag indicating whether this child was not present in the registration data. This means we have no date of birth and hence cannot calculate z-scores
flag_flip,"Flag indicating whether the height and weight for this child were flipped around. For all children the flipped z-score is calculated, and only if no WHO-flags are TRUE, are the values flipped. Though not very common, some children are for instance given a height of 5 and weight of 60. These values are both clearly impossible and changing them to be a height of 60 and weight of 5 is taken when this sets of no WHO-flags"
