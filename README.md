# Max Foundation Bangladesh
All Open Data from Max Foundation Bangladesh


### Max Foundation
Max Foundation is a Netherlands-based NGO that works towards a healthy start for every child in the most effective and long-lasting way. Over the past 15 years, our teams in Bangladesh and Ethiopia have reached almost 3 million people, supporting communities in reducing stunting and undernutrition by gaining better access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as healthy diets and care for mother and child. 

Maximising our impact and cost efficiency are at the core of our work, which makes quantifying and analysing our programmes crucial. We therefore collect a lot of information on the communities we work with; to understand them better and see where and how we can improve as an organisation.  
This data set is one of many we are making publicly available because we believe that data in the development sector should be open: not as a goal in itself, but as a way to help the sector be more effective and create more impact.


### Content
These data are collected by Max Foundation Bangladesh to help us understand and analyse our impact on the communities we work with. There are several datasets that cover a variety of topics, and some are updated quarterly while others are one-off datasets.

The names of the datasets end in "_anon" and the description of the variables can be found in the file ending with "_vars".


### Privacy and links to our other data
All of Max Foundation's data are collected and processed according to GDPR standards and explicit informed consent is given by the parents of the children. 

Furthermore, we enforce strong privacy protections on our open data to minimise the risk of these data being used to cause harm or re-identify individuals.
Concretely this means:
- Administrative units up to the Union can be directly identified with the BD _loc _xx data, whereas village are masked by random numbers. However, to ensure it is still possible to compare our datasets, these random numbers are consistent across all datasets. This means that village '1' in this data is the same as village '1' in all of our other Bangladesh datasets, unless stated otherwise;
- Household numbers are randomised and these are NOT kept the same between datasets (the only exception being the two datasets with anthropomorphic measures of children, here household IDs are consistent, as are the child IDs);
- Dates are censored to the quarter in which the measurements were taken;
- Sensitive data is either dropped from the data complete, censored or bucketed. 

The column descriptions specify any transformations done to the data.


### Acknowledgements
These data could have not been collected without the generous support from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Dhaka and numerous other donors who have supported us over the years. Special thanks to our Bangladesh team for their excellent work in guiding the data collection process.


### What you can do for our communities
We invite you to share any interesting insights you have derived from the data with us. From visualising our impact, to uncovering which parts of our programmes are most strongly related with reducing stunting, to making new connections we may have not even considered; we are eager to hear how we can be more effective in what we do and how we do it. 

More detailed data insights are available from our internal data, such as the linking of households between datasets. Please note that we would be  happy to share more detailed data with researchers, students and many others once proper agreements are in place.  

As we value impact above all else, we are happy to work with anyone who can help us to improve our impact. We are constantly adapting our approach based on internal and external findings, and invite you to join us on this journey. Together we can ensure that every child has a healthy start.
