# Programme Data


### Content
These data were collected between 2017 and 2021 by our partner NGOs on the work they have conducted in our implementation areas. They are collected to help us, and our donors, in the Monitoring & Evaluation of our programmes to ensure budgets are well spent and intermediary-outcomes (so not at the impact-level) are achieved. The data are in 3 datasets, covering hardware, ante and postnatal care information and the number of courtyard session organised. The courtyard sessions are a cornerstone in triggering behaviour change and providing communities with information on how their choices in water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as care and nutrition impact the health of themselves, their families and their community.
